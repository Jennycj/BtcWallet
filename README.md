# How to use this repo

This repo is divided into four different branches that follow the flow of the workshop's instructions:

- `part1`: A barebones version of this project with no bitcoin code written.
- `part2`: Mnemonic generated, private key, xpub, and addresses derived and displayed in UI.
- `part3`: Above functionality plus transaction data and UTXO data displayted in UI.
- `complete`: Above functionality plus transaction creation, signing, and broadcasting functionality.

Each branch is a starting off point for the next part of the workshop.

These are to provide a starting point for participants that join late or get stuck on past parts of the workshop and want to continue following along.
